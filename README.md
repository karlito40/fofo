## Usage & Installation

### Api

First make sure to follow the [laravel installation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/homestead) and install all the dependencies.

`cd fofo-api && composer install`

Next, create the database.

`php artisan migrate`

Generate the oauth tables and encryption keys.

`php artisan passport:install`

Generate a password oauth client. 

`php artisan passport:client --password`

Create the .env

`cp .env.development .env`

Edit and add to `.env` your fresh oauth client_id and secret.

```
OAUTH_PASSWORD_CLIENT_ID=2
OAUTH_PASSWORD_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
```

Follow this [tutorial](https://medium.com/@adnanxteam/how-to-setup-https-with-laravel-homestead-ad7915470fa8) to make the https works on your server. Next, go to https://your-local-api-domain and accept the certificate.

Now, run the seeder to add some data to your database.

`php artisan db:seed`

You may import `fofo-api.postman_collection.json` into postman to check the api.

### Front

The front can be run independently from the WebExtension. 

`cd fofo-front && npm run start`

Alternatively, you may execute the script from the root directory to achieve the same.

`npm run start-front`

### WebExtension

Build the project from the root directory

`npm run build-web-ext`

Next, go to **[chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)**, active the developer mode and load the unzip extension from `fofo-web-ext/dist`
